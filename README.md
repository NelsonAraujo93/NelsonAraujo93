  <h1><b>Nelson Araujo</b></h1>
  <h3><b>Multimedia Engineer - Full Stack developer</b></h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> I am a highly qualified and experienced multimedia engineer with 3 years of experience in web development. I did finish the Microverse program where I expanded my skillset by learning best practices in programming on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and SQL. I had a proven track record of delivering high-quality projects and has experience working with a variety of technologies such as React, Vue, and Node.js. My ability to not only produce high-quality technical work but also create a positive and productive environment sets me apart from the competition.

In my three years of experience in web development, I had built not only web applications, but also I had deployed applications in Google Play store and Appstore, but this experience also helped me to learn the standards of deployment in such servers of high-quality demand. In my experience, I used to work with agile methodologies as SCRUM being not only part of a team but also Scrum Master many times. I built and deploy E-Commerce, User session applications, management applications, Transaction applications, and Multi-language applications.

But I am not only a skilled multimedia engineer but also a friendly, tolerant, respectful, dynamic, communicative, organizer, and attuned to others, making me a valuable asset to any team. This unique combination of technical expertise, positive attitude, and soft skills makes me the perfect candidate for any web development project.
